## Introduction
This repository contains a short implementation of a mathematical representation of chaos theory, where circles bounce inside another circle. A small change in the initial conditions can cause the system to exhibit chaotic behavior after some time.

All you see here is made with math and fragment shaders, meaning that no assets are needed.
